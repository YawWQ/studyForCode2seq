# studyForCode2seq
 
 1. I changed some parameters of code2seq in "code2seq-master" and "code2vec-master" for optimizing and evaluating the performance.
 
 The original projects are provided by Uri Alon:
 
 https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq
 
 https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec
 
 2. I also add ProcessJava.java to process some other Java code.
 
 3. "code2seqForPytorch.ipynb" is changed from https://github.com/m3yrin/code2seq, it is a PyTorch version of code2sed, contributed by the user m3yrin.
 I change it a version can directly running on Colab and Jupyter notebook.
 
 4. The further trained model is in "furtherTrainedModel"
 
 5. The processed Python dataset is in "processedDataset"
